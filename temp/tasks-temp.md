I can help you parse the PRD document to generate a comprehensive task breakdown. Based on the updated PRD.md content I just edited, here's how I would approach parsing it into actionable tasks:

## Task Breakdown from PRD Document

### 1. **UI/UX Design Tasks**
- [ ] Design horizontal AI service pane layout
- [ ] Create settings popup page UI components
- [ ] Design input area and send button functionality
- [ ] Create responsive layout for all screen sizes

### 2. **Core Functionality Implementation**
- [ ] Implement AI service pane component with horizontal alignment
- [ ] Build individual service running logic
- [ ] Develop question injection mechanism into service inputs
- [ ] Implement send button clicking automation

### 3. **Settings System Development**
- [ ] Create settings popup page component
- [ ] Implement service configuration interface
- [ ] Build save and apply settings functionality
- [ ] Add settings persistence logic

### 4. **User Flow Implementation**
- [ ] Implement user input handling
- [ ] Create service selection mechanism
- [ ] Develop question injection and send automation
- [ ] Build response display in individual panes

### 5. **Technical Integration**
- [ ] Set up multi-LLM API connectivity
- [ ] Implement request routing logic
- [ ] Build response aggregation system
- [ ] Create configuration management system

### 6. **Testing and Quality Assurance**
- [ ] Unit tests for AI service panes
- [ ] Integration tests for service automation
- [ ] UI testing for settings popup
- [ ] User flow testing scenarios

### 7. **Documentation and Setup**
- [ ] Update PRD with implementation details
- [ ] Create developer documentation
- [ ] Write user guides for new features
- [ ] Document API integration points

This parsing approach would break down the requirements into manageable development tasks with clear dependencies and priorities.
